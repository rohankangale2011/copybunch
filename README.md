# copybunch
An OS utility that keep track of your multiple copied items and remind you while pasting

It becomes a headache when a user has to copy multiple items from a source location to destination location. Until a user paste the selected copied item, one can't copy another instance and thus result in copy paste a single item/instance always. We are solving this problem by keeping a buffer of copied items and let user choose from the same. Every time the user copies an item, a new buffer will be created and when user performs paste(introducing a new HOTKEY for multi copy+paste), the list of all buffer items will be shown from which the user can select the required item. It will not only save time, but provide a much better way for performing copy + paste functionality at operating system level.
